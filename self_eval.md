## Self Evaluation

### When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?

Conditionals are useful if you have multiple variables and you need to compare them to each other or you need to check values against each other.

### If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?

I would have done it at my desk with my external monitor plugged in. I didn't realize how much more space it gives me and how much I use it until I didn't have it.

### What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?

I was really satisfied with how quickly I was able to complete the coding challenges. I do have a tiny amount of experience in C++ and Java, but that was from over a decade ago.
